About Me ðŸ’»
I'm a Data Analyst driven by the belief that data tells a powerful story. My mission is to translate that story into actionable intelligence that drives business value and growth. I leverage my analytical mindset to understand the "why" behind human behavior and business trends.


My approach covers the full data lifecycle; from meticulous cleaning to insightful analysis and clear visualization. I help businesses and entrepreneurs move from uncertainty to clarity, enabling them to identify trends, optimize processes, and unlock growth.


What sets me apart: A blend of technical skills and a genuine curiosity. I'm naturally adaptable and continuously exploring new tools and techniques to bring innovative, data-driven perspectives to every project.


What I Do
 * Data Preparation & Management: Meticulous collecting, cleaning, and transforming datasets to ensure reliability and accuracy.
 * Analysis & Exploration: Using tools like SQL and Python to surface key insights and understand complex business problems.
 * Visualization & Storytelling: Creating clear, compelling dashboards (Tableau/Power BI) and reports that turn data into clear business narratives.
